      <h4>Terms and Conditions</h4>
      <p> <i>Please read these terms carefully. This is a binding agreement between ROJO, LLC (referred to as “ROJO,” we,” “us” or “our”) and any person who has indicated their assent hereto by clicking “I agree” or similarly expressing acceptance. Any persons who access or establish a connection to the Services will also be deemed to have accepted the terms of this agreement.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>1. ACCESS TO THIS SITE</b>
        To access any part of this website, http://www.ROJO.com (the “Website”), the ROJO mobile application (the “Application”) or other software, resources or services made available by ROJO (all of the foregoing, the “Services”), you are asked to provide registration information. It is a condition of your use of the Services that all the information you provide is correct, current, and complete. ROJO may terminate or suspend your access to the Services, if ROJO believes the information you provide is inaccurate.

        You agree that ROJO may, without prior notice for any reason or no reason, immediately terminate your account and access to the Services. You agree that all terminations for cause will be made in ROJO’s discretion and that ROJO will not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your account.
        <br>
        <b>2.  HOW THE SERVICES WORK</b>
        The core of the Services is an online marketplace where registered members (“Members”) who own parking spots (“Owners” and “Parking Spots,” respectively) to list those Parking Spots (each, a “Listing”) and make them available for rent to Members who wish to use them (“Renters”). Anyone may view Listings as an unregistered user of the Services, however, only Members may list or make reservations of Parking Spots.

        ROJO is not an owner of Parking Spots or a representative of owners of Parking Spots. ROJO does not rent, manage or control Parking Spots. ROJO’s responsibilities are limited to: (1) facilitating the availability of the Services, and (2) serving as the limited payment collection agent of Owners for the purpose of accepting payments from Renters.

        ACCORDINGLY, ROJO IS NOT RESPONSIBILE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY RELATED TO LISTINGS, RESERVATIONS, PARKING SPOTS, AND THE TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN OWNERS AND RENTERS DESCRIBED HEREIN.
        <br>
        <b>3. RESERVATIONS</b>
        Owners are solely responsible for honoring any reservations and making available any Parking Spots reserved through the Services. If you, as a Renter, choose to enter into a transaction with an Owner for the reservation of a Parking Spot, you understand and agree that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Owner and you must honor any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Parking that you have accepted. Once a reservation is confirmed, ROJO will send both Owner and Renter a confirmation email summarizing the transaction.
        <br>
        <b>4. FEES</b>
        In consideration of providing the Services, ROJO charges service fees to both Owners and Renters (“Owner Service Fees” and “Renter Service Fees,” respectively, and together, the “Services Fees”). Renters are also responsible for paying the fees set by Owners for Parking Spots (the “Parking Fees”). Parking Fees and Renter Service Fees are collectively referred to herein as the “Total Renter Fees.” Where applicable, taxes may also be charged. You as a Renter agree to pay ROJO the Total Renter Fees for any reservation requested through your ROJO Account. ROJO deducts the Owner Service Fees from the Parking Fees before remitting the balance to the Owner.

        ROJO will collect the Total Renter Fees at the time the reservation is made by the Renter and will pay the Parking Fees (less the Owner Service Fees and any taxes ROJO is required to withhold) to the Owner on a monthly basis. The time it takes for the Owner to receive payouts may depend upon the method that the Owner choose for receiving payouts. Some methods involve the use of third-party payment processors, who may impose their own additional charges for the use of their services directly on the Owner.

        Each Owner hereby appoints ROJO as the Owner’s limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Parking Fees from Renters. In accepting this appointment, ROJO assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Owner.

        If you are directed to ROJO’s third-party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review these third-party terms and conditions and privacy policies before using the services.

        Credits and Promo Codes. You may receive credits (“ROJO Credits”) that you can apply toward payment upon booking of a parking space. ROJO Credits are only valid for use on the ROJO Platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash except as required by law. ROJO Credits cannot be combined, and if the cost of parking exceeds the applicable credit or discount value we will charge your payment method on file for the outstanding cost. Additional restrictions on ROJO Credits may apply as communicated to you in a relevant promotion.
        <br>
        <b>5. CANCELLATIONS AND REFUNDS</b>
        As a Renter, you may cancel your reservation for a Parking Spot only in accordance with the cancellation policy of the Owner contained in the original Listing, or with the permission of the Owner, and ROJO will refund any amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the canceled reservation within a reasonable time. However, regardless of the cancellation policy set by the Owner, the Renter Service Fee is non-refundable. ROJO will, however, refund the Owner Service Fee.

        As an Owner, you may cancel a reservation for a Parking Spot up to 24 hours before the scheduled start time of the reservation (“Owner Cancellation Period”). If as an Owner you cancel a reservation request within the Owner Cancellation Period, any amounts collected by ROJO for the requested reservation will be refunded to the Renter’s credit card. The Owner Service Fee is non-refundable. ROJO will, however, refund the Renter Service Fee.

        ROJO may apply penalties to or impose consequences for Owner cancellations, including (1) publishing an automated review on your Listing indicating that a reservation was cancelled, (2) keeping the calendar for your Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled reservation, or (3) imposing a cancellation fee up to $50 (which may be withheld from your future payouts). You will be notified of the situations in which a cancellation fee applies before you decide to cancel.

        In certain exceptional circumstances, ROJO may decide that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed reservation, in which case ROJO may also determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to the Renter all or part of the Parking Fee. You agree that ROJO and the relevant Renter or Owner will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.
        <br>
        <b>6. TAXES</b>
        Depending on the amount of Parking Fees you earn through the Services, tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information from you as Owner, or to withhold taxes from payouts to you, or both. If we request information from you for this purpose, you agree to provide it promptly and to keep it current, complete and accurate. If you as Owner fail to provide us with information or documentation that we determine to be necessary to meet our obligations to withhold taxes, we may suspend payouts to you until we receive the information necessary to enable us to withhold the amounts required by law.

        You as Owner understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (1) your applicable tax reporting requirements, and (2) the taxes that should be charged at the time of reservation. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any taxes received by you. ROJO cannot and does not offer tax-related advice to any Members.
        <br>
        <b>7. DAMAGE TO PROPERTY</b>
        You as Renter are responsible for leaving the Parking Spot in the condition you found it in when you arrived. ROJO may in its discretion provide tools as part of the Services to enable Owners and Renters to communicate about issues that may arise relating to property damage. However, ROJO is not responsible to take any specific steps to investigate or mediate disputes. The responsibility to address and resolve any such issues lies solely with Owners and Renters.

        You as a Renter understand and agree that you are parking at your own risk and the owner is not responsible for any damage to your car or the loss of personal belongings left in the car.
        <br>
        <b>8. TERMINATION OF ACCOUNT</b>
        If you wish to terminate your account, you may do so by contacting us at http://www.ROJO.com/contact or by calling Customer Service at (773) 770-5223. All provisions of these Terms of Use, which by their nature should survive termination of your account will survive, including but not limited to, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
        <br>
        <b>9. PRIVACY</b>
        ROJO’s Privacy Policy, located at http://www.ROJO.com/privacy-policy , describes ROJO’s collection and use of your personal and other information.

        <br>
        <b>16. LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY</b>
        In no event will the collective liability of ROJO and its officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries, licensors, vendors and other related parties (together, the “ROJO Parties”), regardless of the legal theory under which liability is asserted, exceed the greater of $500 or the amount that you have paid to ROJO for the Services during the most recent 12-month period.

        The ROJO Parties are not liable for any incidental, indirect, punitive, actual, consequential, special, exemplary, or other damages, including loss of revenue or income, pain and suffering, emotional distress, or similar damages, even if you have advised them of the possibility of such damages.

The parties shall mutually agree upon a single commercial arbitrator, and in the absence of agreement, the AAA shall select the arbitrator. The place of arbitration shall be Chicago, Illinois. The parties will share equally in the costs of arbitration payable to the AAA, including the arbitrator. The award of the arbitrator will be accompanied by a reasoned opinion. Judgment on an arbitration award may be entered in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act in any federal court having jurisdiction.

        You acknowledge and agree that you and ROJO are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and ROJO otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.

        The parties to this agreement may, notwithstanding the above, seek equitable relief in any proper court to enjoin a breach or threatened breach of any obligations under this agreement that might cause irreparable harm (without any requirement to post bond).
